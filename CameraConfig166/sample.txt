FRC Axis 206 Camera Demonstration Program
-----------------------------------------

This is based on the SimpleDemo program, with changes in autonomous for 
camera configuration. There are a number of options as described below,
with more extensive explanation in the program header:

SNAPSHOT;
    Stores an image from the camera on the cRIO. 
RESET; 	
	Set camera settings back to a known default. 
CONFIG_BRIGHTNESS; 	
	Set camera brightness to several values in the brightness  
	range (0-100) and take a snapshot of each one.
CONFIG_WHITEBALANCE; 
	Set camera white balance to each possible value 
	and take a snapshot of each one.
CONFIG_EXPOSURE; 
	Set camera exposure to each possible value 
	and take a snapshot of each one.
CONFIG_EXPOSURE_PRIORITY; 
	Set camera exposure priority to each possible value 
	and take a snapshot of each one.
CONFIG_COLOR_LEVEL; 
	Set camera color level to several values in the color level  
	range (0-100) and take a snapshot of each one.
CONFIG_SHARPNESS; 
	Set camera sharpness to several values in the sharpness 
	range (0-100) and take a snapshot of each one.
GET_CAMERA_CONFIG; 	
	This queries the camera and prints to the console 
	the following properties of the camera:
	Sensor Properties: Brightness, White Balance, Exposure, 
		Exposure Priority, Color Level, Sharpness
	Image Properties: Resolution, Compression, Rotation	
READ_FILE; 		
	Uses the utility ProcessFile to obtain camera configuration settings
	from a file called "166Camera.txt" on the cRIO. This configuration 
	is then set on the camera. 
	
	A sample 166Camera.txt file is included with this project. Note that
	it must be ftp'd to the root directory of the cRIO for this feature to work.
